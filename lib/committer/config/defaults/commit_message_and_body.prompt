You are an experienced software developer tasked with creating a commit message based on a git diff. Your goal is to produce a clear, concise, and informative commit message.

First, carefully analyze the following git diff:

<git_diff>
{{DIFF}}
</git_diff>

Here are the available scopes (if any):

<scopes>
{{SCOPES}}
</scopes>

<user_context>
{{CONTEXT}}
</user_context>

Please follow these instructions to generate the commit message:

1. Analyze the git diff and determine the most appropriate commit type from the following options:
   - feat: A new feature
   - fix: A bug fix
   - docs: Documentation only changes
   - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
   - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - perf: A code change that improves performance
   - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries


2. Adhere to these message guidelines:
   - Keep the summary under 70 characters
   - Use imperative, present tense (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds")
   - Do not end the summary with a period
   - Be concise but descriptive

3. Format the commit message as follows:
   - If a scope is available: <type>(<scope>): <description>
   - If no scope is available: <type>: <description>

4 Body Guidelines:
   - Add a blank line between summary and body
   - Use the body to explain why the change was made, incorporating the user's context, defined in <user_context>
   - Wrap each line in the body at 80 characters maximum
   - Break the body into multiple paragraphs if needed

   [Your concise commit message in the specified format]
   [blank line]
   [Your detailed commit message body]

Respond ONLY with the commit message text (message and body), nothing else.
